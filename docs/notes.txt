evolvable, declarative, typed

Interesting type-oriented features:
Is a given schema "complete?"
  All named types can be resolved
Can we serve the given complete schema?
  Must have Query type with appropriate attrs
Is a given set of operations valid?
  All fragments can be resolved
  All variables are used
Can a valid set of operations be performed against this valid schema?
  All named types can be resolved
  More? https://facebook.github.io/graphql/#sec-Validation

  Shape and attributes are correct
